# Introduction

### What is FMVC?

FMVC is a MVC framework for PHP apps. As other frameworks often seemed to big for my use case, I started to write my own. Now it is not as small as it once was and I just create yet-another-MVC-framework...

But it was/is fun to develop. So if you want to try it: enjoy!
