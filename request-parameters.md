# Request Parameters

"Sometimes", we will need to access the parameters sent by the request. So the request object, that is being passed to the controller contains a property called `params` .

This object is an associative array with all parameters \(query, body, etc.\) as key =&gt; value pair.

That's it. That's the tea.
